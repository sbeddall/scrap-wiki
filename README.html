<h1>Scrap Wiki</h1>

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> The lightest weight of lightweight wiki solutions. </p>

<p>As a user, I got sick of coming up with wonky ways of making my scrap notes organizable/usable. OneNote didn't do it for me, and a lot of the solutions that I've seen don't really do what I want as far as simplicity.</p>

<p>ScrapWiki features:</p>

<ul>
<li>[x] Docs written in MARKDOWN. Needs to be SIMPLE DAMNIT!</li>
<li>[x] Reference other markdown files via relative path. The path will be taken resolved for you.</li>
<li>[x] Anything under <code>source/</code> will be built into the equivalent folder in <code>target/</code> as html.</li>
</ul>

<p>Shit I want, so it'll get implemented:
- [ ] Custom Tagging
- [ ] Search files by tag</p>

<h1>Invocation Instructions</h1>

<ol>
<li><code>python -m pip install -r _internal/requirements.txt</code></li>
<li>python rebuilt.py</li>
</ol>
