# Scrap Wiki

**tl;dr** The lightest weight of lightweight wiki solutions. 

As a user, I got sick of coming up with wonky ways of making my scrap notes organizable/usable. OneNote didn't do it for me, and a lot of the solutions that I've seen don't really do what I want as far as simplicity.

Check the github.io for this project for an easy demo of output. You can see input in the `source` directory of this repo.

ScrapWiki features:

- [x] Docs written in MARKDOWN. Needs to be SIMPLE DAMNIT!
- [x] Reference other markdown files via relative path. The path will be taken resolved for you.
- [x] Anything under `source/` will be built into the equivalent folder in `docs/` as html.
- [x] Tested on Python 3.7

Shit I want, so it'll get implemented:
- [ ] Custom Tagging
- [ ] Search files by tag
- [ ] Add git hook that runs a cred check to prevent accidental commit of secrets
- [ ] 
- [ ] Add file change hook to rebuild documents on the fly
- [ ] Add a configuration file
- [ ] Force my pile of garbage self to actually get a design that looks something close to reasonable.

## The Iffy Part

# Invocation Instructions

1. `python -m pip install -r _internal/requirements.txt`
2. `python scrapwiki.py build`

## Commands

`build`: Generates html from your source folder. Single pass.
`serve`: Generates html from your source folder, serves using basic http server, and polls/regenerates updated files.

## Optional Arguments

`--clean`: Entirely empties the `docs` directory and re-outputs.
